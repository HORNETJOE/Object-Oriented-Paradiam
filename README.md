# Object-Oriented-Paradigm

## What are the characteristics of Object Oriented Paradigm
Object Oriented Paradigm is form of programming which uses objects to increase the reusability and efficiency of a program or a section of a program by creating classes which contain a set of instructions or information that can then be used throughout the program. These classes are useful in programs to contain valuable information that is used/edited in different parts of the program.
