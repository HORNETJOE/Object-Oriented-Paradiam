# Object-Oriented-Paradigm

## What are the characteristics of Object Oriented Paradigm
Object Oriented Paradigm is form of programming which uses objects to increase the reusability and efficiency of a program or a section of a program by creating classes which contain a set of instructions or information that can then be used throughout the program. These classes are useful in programs to contain valuable information that is used/edited in different parts of the program.

## Class Relationship
### Inheritance
Inheritance is when a class is created through an existing class. The existing class is called the parent class and the class that is created from that parent is called the child class. Creating a child class saves time for the programmer and save the creator from creating more of the same variable on the program. AN example of an inheritance would be employees at a school. The parent class would be staff members working at the school and one of the child classes could be teachers that work at the school. Another class from the first parent class would be maintenance staff at the school such as computer cleaners and security.
